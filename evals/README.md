# OpenWork UI evals

Human-readable scenarios and coded flows that verify end-to-end OpenWork UI
behavior against a live app.

Each eval should have:
- A short narrative spec written in plain English.
- An **expected outcome** with observable signals.
- A coded flow under [`flows/`](./flows) when it is used for PR evidence or
  repeated regression coverage.

They are not unit tests. They intentionally exercise the running stack
(OpenCode + OpenWork server + React UI) so regressions in wiring — not just
types — get caught.

## Coded flows (programmatic runner)

A growing subset of flows is codified under [`flows/`](./flows) and executed by
the zero-dependency runner in [`runner/`](./runner) with machine-checkable
assertions, poll-until-condition waits (no fixed sleeps), and JSON + markdown
reports with screenshots. The runner also writes a browseable frame-by-frame
`index.html` in each result directory.

```bash
pnpm evals --list                 # show available coded flows
pnpm evals --all                  # run everything runnable
pnpm evals --flow app-smoke       # run one flow
pnpm evals --all --cdp-url http://127.0.0.1:9825   # explicit CDP endpoint
```

The runner probes `http://127.0.0.1:9825` (Daytona) then `:9823` (local
`pnpm dev`) by default. Flows that need cloud credentials declare
`requiredEnv` and are skipped (not failed) when the env is missing — e.g.
`cloud-signin-handoff` needs `OPENWORK_EVAL_DEN_API_URL` and
`OPENWORK_EVAL_DEN_TOKEN`. Reports land in `evals/results/<run-id>/`
(gitignored). Open `evals/results/<run-id>/index.html` for the frame proof.
A non-zero exit code means at least one flow failed.

### One-command cloud stack

```bash
pnpm evals --all --stack den     # MySQL + schema + den-api + demo seed +
                                 # desktop bootstrap + dev app, then runs flows
pnpm evals --stack-down          # stop what --stack den started
```

`--stack den` is idempotent: each layer (MySQL, schema, den-api, seed, app)
is skipped when already up. It signs in as the seeded demo owner
(`alex@acme.test`) and exports `OPENWORK_EVAL_DEN_API_URL` /
`OPENWORK_EVAL_DEN_TOKEN`, so the env-gated cloud flows run with zero manual
setup. Requires Docker. The MySQL volume survives `--stack-down`, so
subsequent runs skip schema push and seeding.

The markdown specs below remain the source narrative; when codifying a flow,
link the spec via the flow's `spec` field.

## How to run

### Option A: On Daytona (recommended)

Run against a real Electron app in a Daytona cloud sandbox. No local Docker or
display needed. See [`daytona-flows.md`](./daytona-flows.md) for full details.

Quick start:

```bash
daytona organization use "<org-name>"
bash .devcontainer/test-on-daytona.sh [branch-or-commit] --artifacts-volume
pnpm evals --flow app-smoke --cdp-url <printed-electron-cdp-url>
```

### Option B: Local Electron

Start the Electron dev app locally:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Wait ~15s, then use the browser tools against `http://127.0.0.1:9825`.

### Option C: Manual browser/debugging

Open the app and follow the step lists by hand. Use this for exploration or
debugging only; PR evidence for UI changes should use a coded flow when
possible.

## Tool reference

Evals use the CDP browser tools provided by the `opencode-chrome-devtools`
plugin (configured in `.opencode/opencode.json`). Every tool takes
`browser_url` as the first argument.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `browser_list` | List page targets on the CDP endpoint |
| `browser_navigate` | Navigate a target to a URL |
| `browser_snapshot` | Accessibility tree with UIDs |
| `browser_click` | Click by snapshot UID |
| `browser_fill` | Fill input by snapshot UID |
| `browser_eval` | Run JS in the page |
| `browser_screenshot` | Capture PNG |

## Conventions

- Prefer coded flows in `evals/flows/*.flow.mjs` over ad hoc browser tool calls.
- Use runner helpers such as `ctx.clickText`, `ctx.fill`, `ctx.waitFor`,
  `ctx.expectText`, `ctx.expectNoText`, `ctx.expectHashIncludes`,
  `ctx.control`, `ctx.prove`, and validated `ctx.screenshot` calls.
- Prefer `ctx.prove("claim", { action, assert, screenshot })` for PR evidence.
  It records the claim, assertions, screenshot, and validation results together
  so the HTML frame proof explains why each image proves the step.
- Screenshots should include `claim`, `requireText`, `rejectText`, or
  `hashIncludes` whenever possible. A screenshot without an assertion is only a
  visual checkpoint, not proof that the workflow passed.
- Use direct `browser_eval` only for debugging/prototyping or when a flow has
  not yet been codified. If the behavior matters for a PR, codify it before
  calling the UI validation complete.
- For Lexical editors in coded flows, use a synthetic paste/event helper; direct
  DOM manipulation doesn't trigger Lexical state updates.
- For React state injection (e.g., folder picker bypass), use the
  `__reactFiber$` → reducer dispatch pattern documented in `daytona-flows.md`.
- Prefer poll-until-condition waits (`ctx.waitFor`, `ctx.waitForText`) over
  fixed sleeps.

## Evidence and repair standard

Frame proof is the default for UI evals. The generated `index.html` should show
each step, the claim being proven, assertions, screenshot validation checks, and
supporting images. Treat recordings as supplementary evidence for motion, not as
the primary pass/fail source.

Before reporting a flow as passed:
- Confirm every important user-visible claim has an assertion.
- Confirm every important screenshot has validation metadata and is not just a
  loose gallery image.
- Re-capture or repair evidence if the screenshot is duplicated, missing required
  text, showing an error state, or taken on the wrong route.
- For Daytona display screenshots, also verify no native picker, modal, stale
  dialog, or unrelated desktop window is covering the claimed state.
- If the test used API/localStorage/setup shortcuts, label that evidence as setup
  and resume visible proof at the next user-facing step.
