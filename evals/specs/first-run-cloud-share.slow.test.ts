/**
 * CORE JOURNEY: a person opens the app for the first time, signs in to OpenWork
 * Cloud — which hands off to a real browser and comes back — then shares a skill
 * with a colleague by authoring it inside a plugin and putting that plugin on a
 * marketplace the colleague can use.
 *
 * Faithfulness notes:
 *  - The browser hop is real: we capture the URL the app asks the OS to open
 *    (PATH shim over xdg-open, which is what shell.openExternal calls on Linux)
 *    and drive that page in a real Chrome.
 *  - Only the OS protocol dispatch of `openwork://den-auth?grant=…` is bridged,
 *    because a container registers no protocol handler. The grant is the real one
 *    the app generated and the browser approved; it is handed to the product's own
 *    documented entry point for this case.
